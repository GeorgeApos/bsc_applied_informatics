# Data-Structures
Here you will find the codes from the course "Data Structures" of the 2nd semester written in C
The reason I upload these files is because I understand that many colleagues find it difficult to understand how structures work and I want to give my own idea and perspective on this lesson.

DISCLAIMER: Obviously I know that many of the codes could have been written better or that some might not have run
however I think we can learn something from all this.
